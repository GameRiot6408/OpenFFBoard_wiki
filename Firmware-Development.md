## Firmware Development

The Firmware-Git can be found here: [OpenffBoard-Firmware](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard).

At the moment the STM IDE is used to compile the code and upload it to your OpenFFBoard. The IDE can be downloaded here: [IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html#get-software).

For DFU (flashing via USB) you might need a winusb driver. This can be obtained by using [Zadig](http://zadig.akeo.ie/) or installing the STM32CubeProgrammer.
