## Firmware Development

The Firmware-Git can be found here: [OpenffBoard-Firmware](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard).

At the moment the STM IDE is used to compile the code and upload it to your OpenFFBoard. The IDE can be downloaded here: [IDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html#get-software).

To build the firmware yourself you need to clone the firmware-git locally and point the working directory to that path. 
Then select the "OpenFFBoard.ino" project file and let it download the missing firmware components (this may take a few minutes).
Plug in your OpenFFBoard via USB and click the  RUN command. *Further instruction need to be written down*
